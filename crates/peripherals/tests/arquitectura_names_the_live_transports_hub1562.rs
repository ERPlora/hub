//! The hub's own architecture doc cannot bury a printer transport this crate still ships — hub#1562.
//!
//! `ARQUITECTURA.md` kept saying "USB se sigue descartando" (§2.7) and "Transporte: solo RED/LAN
//! (USB/Bluetooth descartados por drivers/mantenimiento)" (§14) long after hub#1083 landed the OS
//! print queue. That doc is what a person — or an agent — reads BEFORE touching printing, so a
//! stale sentence there does not merely age: it teaches the opposite of what the code does, and the
//! reader has no reason to doubt it.
//!
//! The guard is a cross-check between two independent artifacts, never a copy of the prose. The
//! transports come from [`parse_print_target`], the crate's real front door, and the doc has to
//! name every shape that door still accepts while declaring none of them dead. Delete the USB
//! transport for real and its sample id stops parsing, so the doc is free to bury it again.
//!
//! What it catches is the BLANKET verdict — "USB se sigue descartando", with nothing qualifying it.
//! Saying USB is out on Android, on Windows, or through `libusb`/WebUSB/OPOS is true today and has
//! to stay writable, so a sentence that names one of those is left alone. `escritorio`/`macOS`/
//! `Linux` are deliberately NOT on that list: that is where the queue prints, so burying USB there
//! is the regression itself. When hub#1269 lands USB on Windows, `Windows` comes off the list in
//! the same commit.
