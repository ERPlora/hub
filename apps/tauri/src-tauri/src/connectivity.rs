//! What the window shows when the NETWORK dies under it (hub#1716).
//!
//! The shell is a thin client (ADR-0159): everything the user sees is served by a remote origin,
//! so a navigation that never lands is not an edge case — in a bar or a salon the line drops every
//! few days. Until hub#1716 the app had no answer for it. The bundled fallback page existed, but
//! `open_main_window` reached it only from the `Err(_)` arm of `initial.parse::<tauri::Url>()`, a
//! branch whose own comment said it should not happen; every real failure landed on whatever the
//! platform paints on a dead load — a **blank white window** on macOS (WKWebView never finishes a
//! failed provisional navigation) and the grey `ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED` page on Android. A
//! Tauri window has no address bar and no reload button, so neither has a way out: the till is
//! dead until somebody kills the app from the operating system.
//!
//! ## Why a probe and not a load-failure callback
//!
//! There isn't one. Tauri 2 offers `on_navigation` (fires BEFORE the load) and `on_page_load`
//! (`Started`/`Finished`), and "finished" is not portable evidence: Android's WebView fires
//! `onPageFinished` for its own error page, so the load looks successful on precisely the platform
//! where the symptom was measured. What IS portable is asking the network ourselves.
//!
//! The rule is deliberately about TRANSPORT, not about HTTP: any response at all — 200, 404, 502 —
//! means the network is up and the page in the window is the origin's own business (a 404 is
//! [`crate::should_forget_hub`]'s problem, not this module's). Only a transport failure (DNS,
//! connect, timeout) means what the user is looking at cannot be us.
//!
//! ## What it costs
//!
//! Nothing while the network is fine. The guard probes once shortly after boot, once per remote
//! navigation, and then sleeps on a [`Notify`] with no timer at all; it only polls — with backoff —
//! while it is showing the offline page, which is exactly when someone is waiting for the network
//! to come back. That matters: this runs on tablets on mobile data.
