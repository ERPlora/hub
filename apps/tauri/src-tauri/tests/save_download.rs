//! The boundary of `save_download`: where a file the page hands us is allowed to land, and on
//! which platforms landing there means the user can actually find it (hub#480).
//!
//! [ADR-0255](hub#475) gave the installed app a way OUT to the system browser and left three
//! `window.open` calls behind, all of them about **saving a file**. Saving is not navigating: the
//! bytes of a `/files` download, of a backup export and of an invoice PDF are fetched by the page
//! with the hub session attached, so no browser — ours or the user's — can be sent to fetch them
//! again. The page has the bytes; what it lacks is somewhere to put them.
//!
//! In a browser that somewhere is the download manager (`<a download>`). Inside the installed app
//! there is none: wry registers no `DownloadListener` on Android at all, and on the desktop its
//! default handler writes to the OS Downloads folder **without a word** — no shelf, no
//! notification, nothing. So the shell saves the file itself and RETURNS the path, which is the
//! only way the user learns it exists.
//!
//! Two frontiers come with that, and both are here:
//!
//! 1. **The page names a file, never a place.** `download_file_name` reduces whatever it sent to a
//!    single leaf name, so nothing it can say escapes the Downloads folder.
//! 2. **A file the user cannot reach is not saved.** On Android `download_dir()` is
//!    `getExternalFilesDir(DIRECTORY_DOWNLOADS)` — app-scoped storage that, since Android 11, the
//!    system Files app and every file manager refuse to browse. Writing there and reporting success
//!    would be hub#475 again in a nicer costume.
