//! The release gate: what makes a green tag mean "published" (hub#895).
//!
//! `tauri-release.yml` gates each publishing job behind a repository Variable, so an empty
//! Variable turns the job `skipped` — and a skipped job does not colour a run. Three tags in a row
//! finished GREEN having published nothing (the last one v1.0.3, hub#839): the run that shipped
//! everything and the run that shipped nothing looked identical from the outside.
//!
//! The fix is a final `release-gate` job that reads the result of every other job and fails when a
//! channel that was expected to publish did not. The logic lives in `scripts/release-gate.sh` and
//! is exercised by `scripts/release-gate.test.sh`; what CANNOT be tested there is the wiring, and
//! the wiring is where this class of bug hides:
//!
//! * a gate without `always()` is itself skipped the moment anything upstream fails or skips —
//!   the guard disappears exactly when it is needed;
//! * a gate that does not `needs:` a publishing job cannot see it, so adding a fourth channel
//!   tomorrow would silently reopen hub#895 for that channel only;
//! * a job in `needs:` whose result is never handed to the script is in the dependency graph but
//!   invisible to the decision — which reads as "checked" and is not.
//!
//! These assertions are the wiring. They run wherever `cargo test -p erplora-tauri` runs, and
//! `test-shell.yml` triggers on changes to `tauri-release.yml`, so they see the edit that would
//! break them before it merges — rather than on a tag, which cannot be re-run and is public by the
//! time anyone looks.
