//! Which pages of erplora.com the Google Play copy is willing to show INSIDE its own window
//! (hub#1915).
//!
//! The app boots on the SaaS (`/shell/`) and shows its sign-in, sign-up and account pages in the
//! webview. Until this guard `on_navigation` returned `true` without looking, so the window could
//! walk to ANY page of erplora.com — the home page with the plan prices, the public marketplace,
//! the panel with Billing. One vuelta of the Android QA found six such doors (hub#1900, hub#1910,
//! saas#2083, saas#2084, saas#2085 and the «Log Out» + cookie banner of saas#2088), each one closed
//! by hand in its template; the next link somebody adds to the web opens the seventh. Paying for
//! digital goods outside Google Play billing, or being steered there, is a rejection reason.
//!
//! So the APP decides: a short list of SaaS pages it follows, and everything else of the SaaS is
//! refused in the Play copy — whatever the templates say. The other copies (direct install,
//! Microsoft Store) keep following every link, exactly as before.
//!
//! What is deliberately NOT policed: pages that are not the SaaS. Hubs are where the app lives, the
//! loopback is development, the bundled page is ours, and foreign hosts keep today's behaviour —
//! the payment pages this guard exists for are reached through the SaaS, and the SaaS is what the
//! list covers.
