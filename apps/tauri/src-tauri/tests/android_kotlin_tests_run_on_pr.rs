//! Guard on WHERE the plugin's Kotlin unit tests run, and on the standalone project that lets
//! them (hub#933).
//!
//! The Kotlin side of the Android plugin — `PermissionPolicy`, `statusOf`, `requestScope`,
//! `BluetoothSpp` — is where the decisions live, and it has 34 unit tests. Until hub#933 the only
//! place they ran was the `build-android` job of `tauri-release.yml`, which fires on a `v*` tag or
//! by hand. So the tests guarded nothing on a PR: `48f2b0e1` (Bluetooth SPP, hub#388) added a
//! permission to the policy, left one expectation stale, and `develop` stayed red for a day
//! without a single check going amber. The next tag would have found it — in the middle of a
//! release, which is the worst possible place to learn about a one-line test expectation.
//!
//! They ran only there for a concrete reason, not by neglect: the Gradle project under
//! `gen/android` cannot be configured without `tauri.settings.gradle` and `app/tauri.build.gradle.kts`,
//! and BOTH are written by `cargo tauri android build`. Running the tests therefore meant paying
//! for the whole Android release build (NDK, four Rust target triples, ~60 min) to reach a step
//! that takes 12 seconds.
//!
//! `crates/tauri-plugin-erplora-android/android-tests/` breaks that coupling: a tiny standalone
//! Gradle root that includes ONLY the plugin library and the `tauri-android` SDK it compiles
//! against, with no `:app` and therefore nothing generated. Measured on this tree: 22 s from cold,
//! 1 s warm, with a JDK and the Android SDK and no NDK or Rust at all.
//!
//! What this file defends is the wiring itself, because both halves fail silently:
//!
//! - a CI step that stops running does not announce it — it just stops being in the log, and the
//!   next stale expectation waits for a tag again;
//! - the standalone project repeats the AGP and Kotlin versions of the generated root, and a
//!   version that drifts does not error either. It compiles the same Kotlin with a different
//!   compiler than the release does, so the check goes green while testing something the shipped
//!   APK is not.
//!
//! Both are cheap to assert from here, and this test already runs on every PR that touches the
//! shell or the plugin (`test-shell.yml`).
