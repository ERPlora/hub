//! What the release workflow assumes about the machine it runs on (hub#878).
//!
//! `tauri-release.yml` builds four platforms. Windows and macOS run on GitHub-hosted runners
//! because there is nowhere else to run them; Linux and Android moved to `ci-runner-1`, our own
//! box. Every time that move bit us it was the same shape of bug: **a step that only worked
//! because of something the hosted image happened to give it**, and the red it produced never
//! looked like its cause.
//!
//! `v1.1.0` lost both self-hosted jobs at once:
//!
//! * **Linux** — `tauri-action` falls back to `npm install -g @tauri-apps/cli` when the project
//!   does not depend on the CLI. On a hosted runner the user owns `/usr/lib/node_modules`; on
//!   `ci-runner-1` it belongs to root, so the install died with `EACCES` before a single line of
//!   Rust was compiled. The build only ever worked because of a filesystem permission.
//! * **Android** — `android-actions/setup-android` downloads the command line tools from
//!   `dl.google.com`, which answers **404 to this machine over IPv6** (and 200 over IPv4 —
//!   verified from the runner: `curl -6` 404, `curl -4` 206, for every path under that host).
//!   Hosted runners have no IPv6, so the download could never take the broken road there.
//!
//! Both of those are invisible in the YAML: nothing in it says "this needs a writable
//! `/usr/lib`" or "this needs the IPv4 road to Google". These assertions say it, so that removing
//! either guard fails here instead of on the next tag — which is the worst possible place to find
//! out, because a tag is not re-runnable and a release with two platforms missing is already
//! public by the time anyone looks.
