//! The two ends of the update channel of the installed app (hub#400), each of which fails MUTELY.
//!
//! The web app asks the shell "which build are you?" and compares it with what the Cloud
//! publishes. Neither half of that is code in this crate — the question is TypeScript and the
//! answer comes from a command — which is exactly why they need a guard here: **both ends can be
//! removed without anything failing to compile.**
//!
//! * The question goes, first, to Tauri's own `plugin:app|version` — the one an app installed
//!   before this channel existed answers — and, where that is refused, to `erplora_bridge_status`,
//!   which carries the same version sealed by the release. Drop the second one and every app built
//!   from hub#2658 on goes quiet, forever, with no error anywhere.
//! * Stop publishing the version manifest from the release workflow and the Cloud has nothing to
//!   report. Same silence, other end.
//!
//! And the version belongs to the LINKED hub (hub#2658): `core:app` is a Tauri plugin no gate can
//! stand in front of, so the hub PWA's capability does not grant it — otherwise any page under
//! erplora.com (another business, the website, the test SaaS) reads which build the till runs.
//! `erplora_bridge_status` is one of the app's own commands, behind `src/hub_link.rs`.
//!
//! Neither is hypothetical bookkeeping: silence is the *correct* behaviour of the feature when it
//! cannot check, so a broken update channel is indistinguishable from a healthy one that has
//! nothing to say. Nothing but these assertions would ever notice.
