//! Guard for the Android permissions the till needs to reach its hardware (hub#337, ADR-0196 §9).
//!
//! Android's twin of `macos_local_network.rs`, and the same failure mode: a missing permission
//! does not raise anything. It makes the hardware **quietly unreachable** — the sweep of port 9100
//! becomes 254 timeouts and the till reports an empty venue while the printer sits there switched
//! on. Since ADR-0196 the installable app is the ONLY way to the hardware, so this is the whole
//! hardware story on Android, not a corner of it.
//!
//! What makes Android worse than macOS is *where the declaration lives*. `gen/android` is a
//! **generated** project, and this is what `cargo tauri android init` actually does with it —
//! measured with tauri-cli 2.11.2 on this tree, not read in a changelog:
//!
//! - with the manifest present, it leaves the file **untouched**: the hand-written permissions and
//!   comments survive, and `git status` comes back clean;
//! - with the manifest **missing**, it writes Tauri's template back — `INTERNET` and nothing else.
//!   Gone: the four hardware permissions and the `erplora://` intent filter (hub#345). Kept: the
//!   leanback feature and the file provider, which come from the template.
//!
//! So the hazard is not "someone reruns init", it is "the file is not there when init runs": a
//! `rm -rf gen/android` to unstick Gradle, a merge that drops the file, a clean checkout on a
//! machine where it was wiped. And the loss is completely silent — the APK still builds, still
//! installs, still runs. Only the printers stop existing.
//!
//! So the declaration is kept in two places on purpose (the lesson of hub#345, where Android alone
//! needed the deep-link scheme declared twice):
//!
//! 1. in the plugin's own Android library manifest, under `crates/`, where no generator reaches —
//!    the manifest merger folds it back into the APK even if `gen/android` is thrown away and
//!    rebuilt from scratch;
//! 2. in the generated app manifest, which is what a reader opens first.
//!
//! These tests are the tripwire on both, plus one on the release job, which is the only place the
//! *merged* manifest exists at all.
//!
//! Why loudly, and not "it will be obvious": asking for a permission the merged manifest never
//! declared is not answered with a dialog. Android answers DENIED immediately, forever, without
//! showing the user anything. The till would then say "grant local network access to ERPlora in
//! your device settings" (hub#338) and send the user looking for a toggle that does not exist.
