//! Guard on the Android window reserving the top system inset (hub#1719).
//!
//! `MainActivity` opts into edge-to-edge, which on `targetSdk = 36` is not really a choice: from
//! Android 15 the framework lays every window out behind the system bars whether the app asks for
//! it or not. Opting in is half the contract; the other half is reserving the inset, and that half
//! was missing. The WebView therefore started at the physical top of the screen, so **any** page
//! loaded inside it — the sign-in page the SaaS serves, the till, a module — painted over the
//! clock. QA reproduced it twice on 2026-09-09 (emulator `Pixel_10_Pro` / Android 16, APK 1.1.21):
//! the back arrow of the sign-in page landed on top of the system clock, and the search layer of
//! `/m/sales/pos` blacked the status bar out entirely.
//!
//! The reserving itself lives in `SystemBarInsets` (plugin module), where the Kotlin unit tests
//! reach it on every PR. What no unit test can reach is the wiring: `MainActivity` belongs to
//! `:app`, and `:app` cannot even be configured without files that `cargo tauri android build`
//! writes, so nothing compiles it until the release job. Dropping the call would therefore be
//! silent — green PR, green tags, and an APK painting under the clock again — which is exactly the
//! shape of regression this file exists to stop.
//!
//! The same goes for the COLOUR of the reserved strip (hub#1903): it is the window background the
//! app theme declares, and it has to be the header colour of the hub shell in light and in dark,
//! or a band of another colour sits between the clock and the header.
