//! Guard for what the till shows when the NETWORK dies under it (hub#1716).
//!
//! The shell is a thin client (ADR-0159): the window navigates to a remote origin and everything
//! the user sees comes from there. So a failed navigation is not an edge case, it is Tuesday
//! afternoon in a bar — and until hub#1716 the app had no answer for it. `open_main_window` fell
//! back to the bundled page only when the initial URL failed to **parse**, and `on_navigation`
//! returned `true` without ever looking at whether the load succeeded. Everything else landed in
//! whatever the platform's webview paints on a dead load:
//!
//! - on macOS (WKWebView) a **blank white window** — no message at all, no control, nothing;
//! - on Android (Chromium) the grey `ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` / `ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED` page.
//!
//! Both are unrecoverable from inside the app: there is no address bar and no reload button in a
//! Tauri window, so the only way out is killing the app from the operating system. On a counter
//! taking money that is a dead till.
//!
//! What this file pins is the whole way out, in the two halves that can rot independently:
//!
//! 1. **The decision** — `connectivity::next_screen` and the backoff around it. This is what
//!    decides that the window must leave the target for our own page, and what brings it back on
//!    its own when the network returns. Driven here against a REAL `WebviewWindow` on Tauri's mock
//!    runtime, so the test fails if the navigation stops happening, not merely if a bool flips.
//! 2. **The page** — `shell-dist/index.html` must be recognisably ERPlora, must say that it is the
//!    NETWORK and not a crash, must carry its `en` source chain and its `es` translation
//!    (ADR-0055/0199), and its retry control must reach the app instead of reloading itself
//!    (reloading the fallback page re-renders the fallback page: the button was a dead end).
