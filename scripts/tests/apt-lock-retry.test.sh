# Contract test for ERPlora/infra#313 — a job that installs system packages on the SHARED CI
# runner must wait out the apt lock another job holds, instead of dying on it.
#
# WHAT HAPPENED. On 2026-09-26 the Playwright job of hub#2225 went red with every test green: its
# step `Instalar el navegador de Playwright` runs `playwright install --with-deps chromium`, which
# shells out to `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install …`, and another job on the same
# machine was running `apt-get` at that moment:
#
#     E: Could not get lock /var/lib/apt/lists/lock. It is held by process 98241 (apt-get)
#     Installation process exited with code: 100
#
# Re-running the same commit went green. The slots of `ci-runner-1` share one `/var/lib/apt` and
# one `/var/lib/dpkg`, so any two jobs that touch apt at the same time can knock each other over.
#
# WHY A RETRY AND NOT `-o DPkg::Lock::Timeout=N`. That option only makes apt wait for the DPKG
# locks. The lock in the incident is the LISTS lock that `apt-get update` takes, and apt fails on
# it at once whatever the timeout says — measured on 2026-09-27 against apt 2.4.14 (ubuntu:22.04)
# and 2.8.3 (ubuntu:24.04), holding the lock with fcntl from another process: `apt-get -o
# DPkg::Lock::Timeout=60 update` exits 100 in 8 ms. The same goes for a system-wide
# `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d` on the runner, which is why the fix lives here and not in ERPlora/infra.
# Playwright's `--with-deps` also gives no way to pass apt options. So every such step goes
# through `scripts/ci/apt-lock-retry.sh`, which re-runs the command while the failure is a held
# lock, and gives up on anything else at once.
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS.
#   Part 1 — the wrapper itself, against a fake command (no apt, no sudo):
#     1 · a command that fails on a held lock is re-run until it succeeds, and the job is green;
#     2 · any other failure is NOT retried and its exit code comes through untouched;
#     3 · «Could not open lock file» (not root) is not a held lock: no retry;
#     4 · the wait is bounded: past APT_LOCK_WAIT_SECONDS it stops with the command's exit code;
#     5 · the command's output stays visible in the log;
#     6 · a call without a command is a usage error, not a silent green.
#   Part 2 — the workflows, read off the PARSED YAML (discovery-based, every workflow and composite
#     action): every `run:` line that calls `apt-get`/`apt` update|install|upgrade, or Playwright
#     with `--with-deps` / `install-deps`, goes through the wrapper — EVERY such call on the line,
#     each one inside its own command (a wrapper before `&&`/`;`/`||` guards only the call before
#     it; hub#2267, hub#2268). `KNOWN` is the proof the scan
#     still SEES the steps that exist today; the fixtures prove the detector catches the positive
#     and leaves the harmless shapes alone.
