# What it pins (hub#2705, ERPlora/pm#655 J3): the installable app is compiled and tested on the
# three desktop systems it ships to, on the PULL REQUEST that touches it. Until then only Linux
# ran here; Windows and macOS were compiled by `tauri-release.yml` alone, on a `vX.Y.Z` tag — so a
# change that broke the Windows or Mac build was found while cutting the release, with the
# installer. The CI was trimmed to one Linux runner when there was one machine for everything; on
# GitHub's runners (public repo, 08/10) that reason is gone.
#
# What must NOT come back with it:
#   · draft PRs spending minutes (measured 29/08: half the runner minutes were runs cancelled by
#     the reviewer's re-push on drafts) — every job keeps the draft filter;
#   · the Kotlin/Android tests three times — they are JVM tests of the Android plugin, the OS of
#     the runner adds nothing, so they stay on Linux only;
#   · one red system hiding the other two — `fail-fast: false`.
#
# Also hub#2689: a push (to `main`) finishes; only a PR's newer head cancels its older run.
