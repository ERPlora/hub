# Release gate — "a green tag means it published" (hub#895)
#
# Called by the last job of `.github/workflows/tauri-release.yml`. It receives
# the result of every publishing job and decides whether the release actually
# shipped. Three tags in a row (the last one v1.0.3, hub#839) ended GREEN while
# publishing nothing: the publish jobs are gated by repository Variables, an
# empty Variable makes the job `skipped`, and a skipped job does not colour a
# run. A tag that published nothing looked exactly like a tag that published
# everything.
#
# The rule this enforces:
#
#   · a channel that published                  → fine
#   · a channel skipped, Variable empty         → RED, naming the Variable
#   · a channel skipped and DECLARED pending    → green, but warned out loud
#   · a channel that failed or was cancelled    → RED (a declaration excuses a
#                                                 skip, never a failure)
#   · a MANDATORY channel (no gating Variable)  → can never be declared pending
#
# Declaring a channel is the repository Variable `RELEASE_CHANNELS_PENDING`, a
# comma-separated list of channel ids (`store`, `play`). It is the difference
# between "we know Play is not wired yet" and "nobody noticed". Anything in it
# that is not an optional channel of this workflow is itself an error: a guard
# that does not validate its payload fails open, which is the failure mode this
# whole script exists to remove.
#
# Input, all through the environment so the workflow expressions stay in the
# YAML and the decision stays testable (scripts/release-gate.test.sh):
#
#   CHANNELS  one line per publishing channel:
#             id|display name|job result|gating Variable|Variable set?|reference
#             An empty gating Variable marks the channel MANDATORY.
#   BUILDS    one line per build job: id|display name|job result   (optional)
#   RELEASE_CHANNELS_PENDING   comma-separated ids, case/space insensitive
#
# Output: `::error::` / `::warning::` annotations, a job summary table, and an
# exit code. Exit 1 = this tag did not publish what it was supposed to.
