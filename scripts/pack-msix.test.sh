#
# Run:  scripts/pack-msix.test.sh
#
# Why a shell test for a PowerShell script: the MSIX leg only ever runs on a
# Windows runner, behind the `vars.MSIX_IDENTITY_NAME` gate, which is still
# empty. That gate is why hub#577 went unnoticed for months — the packer wrote
# `erplora-bridge.msix` while the workflow uploaded `erplora-app.msix` with
# `if-no-files-found: error`, so the step could never have worked. Nothing
# executed it, so nothing said so.
#
# These tests do NOT run `winapp pack`. They check the things that made that
# bug possible and that are perfectly checkable off Windows: that the names,
# paths and tokens the workflow, the packer and the manifest exchange all agree
# with each other and with the files actually in the repo.

# `beforeBuildCommand`, and since ADR-0154 it has none. hub#878 falsified the
# other half of that reasoning — with no `@tauri-apps/cli` dependency the action
# falls back to `npm install -g`, which needs a writable /usr/lib/node_modules
# and so only ever worked on GitHub-hosted runners. The Linux job of v1.1.0 died
# there with EACCES.
#
# So a JS install is now expected, and what this asserts is that it stays the
# CHEAP one: the CLI only (`--filter @erplora/app`), never the web app's
# dependency tree, in the most expensive workflow we have. The `beforeBuildCommand`
# half stands: bring one back and the front has to be built somewhere.
