"""Writes of base that are not operations: opening the Hub's session for the person the SaaS vouched for, and
the clock of the apps' scheduled tasks (``base.scheduler``).

Not an ``@operation``: it runs before there is an actor, for ``/auth/callback`` only, and needs the
request to log in. Phase 1 keeps it on ``django.contrib.auth`` + ``Membership``; phase 2 replaces
it with the hub's ``DeviceSession`` (PLAN-SAAS §2.1).

Two doors, each with its own local copy of the SaaS account: a customer entering their hub
(:func:`open_session_from_saas`, ``saas:<id>``, never staff) and the platform's staff entering the
Hub admin on the platform host (:func:`open_admin_session_from_saas`, ``saas-staff:<id>``, round 13,
PLAN §18.1). Separate copies, so an account that is both staff and a hub member neither loses
``is_staff`` in the admin nor gains it on its hub when it enters by the other door.
